# ScamDigger Dating Profiles

This repository fronts access to a dataset compiled for enabling the detection
and analysis of romance scam dating profiles. The data is collected by scraping
two sources:

+ An exhaustive scrape of the public data on scammers provided by [scamdiggers](http://scamdigger.com) as of 2017-03-20.
+ A large random sample of approximately 1/3rd of the ordinary dating profiles provided by [datingnmore](http://datingnmore.com) as of 2017-03-22. 

These sources were chosen because of their close comparability, though as is
detailed below, some different profile data is available for scammers and
ordinary users. 

This repository itself only contains the scripts used to collect and process the linked 
data. Raw and prepared forms of the data can be downloaded from the links below.

### Raw

The profile data is stored as individual single-line JSON files, named according
to their page name from the source. The files should concatenate into a JSON-L
format without difficulty.

+ 3,500 [scammer profiles](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/scam-profiles.tar.gz) (1.6 M)
+ 15,000 [ordinary profiles](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/real-profiles.tar.gz) (2 M)
+ 17,500 [profile images](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/images.tar.gz) (118 M)

For those not used to working with JSON, there is a [CSV file](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/profiles.csv)
 available which contains a curtailed selection of the profile data, omitting images, text and 
multi-response items but including a `scam` field to indicate whether the
profile is of a scammer or not (1 is positive). The missing fields can be explored using the below CSV files,
which relate to the other profile data using the username of the profile.

+ [justifications](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/justifications.csv)
+ [tags](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/tags.csv)
+ [images](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/images.csv)
+ [messages](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/messages.csv)
+ [description](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/description.csv)


### Prepared

The following data has been partially cleaned and segmented to support machine learning. Within the original data,
many scammers had fields coded with 'or' values where the annotators have combined multiple sightings of the same
profile using slightly different values for age, occupation, etc. The data below has exploded these options into each 
of the possible combinations. This means there are now 5,402 scam profiles in total. Profiles are randomly assigned to
training, test and validation sets, but without allowing any 'duplicated' scam profiles to appear in both sets.

Other cleaning has included standardising the coding of missing data (including adding all variables to all JSON objects)
and some standardisation of case (but not spelling) on some categorical demographic data. Objects now record their scam
and non-scam status internally, and keys are sorted. All profiles have `latitude`,`longitude` and `country` geocoding
results added, based on queries using the `location` field. Profiles in the _training_ set have a `fold` variable which
divides them into one of 10 randomly assigned folds, for the purposes of internal crossvalidation.

+  [60% training set](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/newtrain.tar.gz) (12,076, 2.5 M) 
+  [20% test set](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/newtest.tar.gz) (4,073, 840 K)
+  [20% validation set](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/newvalidation.tar.gz) (3,973, 813 K)

The complete cleaned data is also available in [CSV](http://betaname.net/resources/data/romance/clean.csv) for easier 
assessment of the demographic variables. This remains mappable to the excluded field files given above.
